# Capstone Project - Team 2

Objective of Capstone Project

•	Store all these data files in an AWS S3 bucket. Do the entire data profiling to understand the trends in data. Build QC checklist based on the data profiling done. Create data catalogs preferably using glue

•	Build custom data processing scripts to clean, process & aggregate data. The scripts should have failure alerts and should also provide a summary report over email

•	The process can be loaded in S3 or moved to a data warehouse. The processed data should be able to be directly consumed by the visualization tool

•	Build a live dashboard to show the various trends across players. The dashboard should be useful for creating player matchups against players/teams

The entire infrastructure should be developed on AWS. You are free to use any services on AWS. You can also use any visualization tool of your choice
